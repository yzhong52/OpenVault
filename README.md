# OpenVault — Agentic Financial Aggregator

Aggregate accounts, balances, and transactions from any financial institution — without API keys, screen-scraping hacks, or third-party integrations.

- **Universal.** Traditional aggregators break when banks change their UI or revoke API access. OpenVault uses an AI agent that reads the page the same way you do — works out of the box for any bank, any UI, with no setup per institution.
- **Private.** Your credentials never leave your machine. OpenVault opens a real browser, logs in as you, and saves data locally. No third party ever sees your account information.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

Set your Anthropic API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

## Usage

**Add an account** (saves credentials to macOS Keychain):

```bash
npm run cli account add
```

You'll be prompted for the institution name, login URL, email, and password. Credentials are stored in the macOS Keychain — you won't be asked again.

**Sync all accounts** (login and print balances):

```bash
npm run cli sync
```

Opens a real Chrome window, logs into each saved account, and prints the accounts and balances to the console.

**Debug mode** — logs each prompt sent to Claude and pauses 1s per tool call:

```bash
DEBUG=1 npm run cli sync
```
