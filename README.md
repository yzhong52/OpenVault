# OpenVault — Agentic Financial Aggregator

Aggregate accounts, balances, and transactions from any financial institution — without API keys, screen-scraping hacks, or third-party integrations.

- **Universal.** Traditional aggregators break when banks change their UI or revoke API access. OpenVault uses an AI agent that reads the page the same way you do — works out of the box for any bank, any UI, with no setup per institution.
- **Private.** Your credentials never leave your machine. OpenVault opens a real browser, logs in as you, and saves data locally. No third party ever sees your account information.

## Setup

Install dependencies and Playwright:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

Save your Anthropic API key to Keychain:

```bash
npm run cli -- config anthropic
```

Optionally, configure Gmail for automatic MFA code retrieval:

```bash
npm run cli -- config gmail
```

## Quick start

Add an institution:

```bash
npm run cli -- institution add
```

Sync that institution:

```bash
npm run cli -- sync --institution "TD"
```

List the latest stored balances:

```bash
npm run cli -- accounts list
```

## Local storage

OpenVault stores all data on your machine:

- Institution metadata is saved in `~/.openvault/accounts.json`
- Passwords are saved in macOS Keychain
- Synced balances are saved in `~/.openvault/data.db`
- Browser session state is saved in `~/.openvault/browser-profile`
- Per-institution agent memory is saved in `~/.openvault/memory/`
- Debug snapshots are saved in `~/.openvault/logs/`

## How it works

Each sync runs a three-step agent pipeline per institution:

1. **Login** (`src/tasks/login.ts`) — navigates to the institution's login page, fills credentials, handles MFA, and waits for the dashboard.
2. **Account discovery** (`src/tasks/accounts.ts`) — scans the dashboard to discover all accounts, types, and balances.
3. **Transactions** — downloads the latest activity and transactions for each account. <!-- TODO: implement src/tasks/transactions.ts -->

After each step, the agent reflects on what worked and what didn't, and writes a short set of notes that are injected into the next session. This means the agent gets faster and more reliable over time for each institution it's seen before.

## Usage

**Add an institution** (saves credentials to macOS Keychain):

```bash
npm run cli -- institution add
```

You'll be prompted for the institution name, login URL, username or email, and password. Credentials are stored in the macOS Keychain — you won't be asked again.

**Sync all institutions:**

```bash
npm run cli -- sync
```

Opens a real Chrome window, logs into each saved institution, extracts all accounts and balances, and saves them to a local SQLite database.

**Sync one institution:**

```bash
npm run cli -- sync --institution "TD"
```

## MFA

OpenVault handles MFA automatically when possible. When a verification code screen appears, it first checks your Gmail inbox for the code — if found, it fills it in without any input from you. If Gmail isn't configured or no code arrives within 60 seconds, it falls back to prompting you to enter the code manually.

**Configure Gmail for automatic MFA** (one-time setup):

```bash
npm run cli -- config gmail
```

See [faq/how_to_config_gmail_for_mfa.md](faq/how_to_config_gmail_for_mfa.md) for setup instructions, including how to forward SMS codes to Gmail if your institution sends MFA codes by text.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an Anthropic authentication error, run `npm run cli -- config anthropic` to save your API key to Keychain.
- If browser launch fails, make sure Google Chrome is installed and `npx playwright install chromium` has been run.
- If MFA auto-fill does not work, run `npm run cli -- config gmail` and verify the Gmail App Password.
- If a login flow breaks after an institution changes its UI, inspect the saved accessibility snapshots in `~/.openvault/logs/`. Sessions are grouped into subfolders named by host and timestamp (e.g. `app_wealthsimple_com_2025-05-28_143022/`). The 10 most recent sessions per host are kept automatically.
- For more verbose agent output, run `DEBUG=1 npm run cli -- sync`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- macOS (Keychain is used for credential storage)
- Google Chrome installed
- Anthropic API key (saved via `npm run cli -- config anthropic`)
